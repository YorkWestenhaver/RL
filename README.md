# RL
Here are some things that I have put together to explain some RL topics over the years, though they are incomplete.

Some of the Latex functions will look like this:

> \color{teal}{R}_\color{green}{t}\overset{\Delta}{=} \color{cyan}{p}_{\color{green}{t}+1}-\color{cyan}{p}_{\color{green}{t}}

Just open the documents in Colab in order to see that material.
